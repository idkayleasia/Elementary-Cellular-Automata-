## Description
This program exemplifies the concept of a One-Dimensional Cellular Automaton, a computational model operating on a linear array with binary states (0s and 1s). Implemented in C++, the automaton adheres to a distinct ruleset designed to dictate the evolution of the system over successive generations. Through the interplay of binary states and a carefully crafted ruleset, the program generates evolving patterns, offering a captivating glimpse into the complexity that can emerge from simple computational rules.

## Usage

The versatility of this program extends beyond its fixed ruleset, allowing users to seamlessly customize and experiment with diverse rulesets. Inspired by the rich repository of rulesets available on Wolfram Math World <br><br>
&#8594; (https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html)<br><br>
Users can explore an array of fascinating cellular automaton behaviors. By modifying the ruleset, individuals have the creative freedom to shape the dynamics and intricate patterns emerging within the one-dimensional cellular automaton.
